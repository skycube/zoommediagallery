5. TODO LIST
------------
- Not much, really. :-D BUT, bugs are inevitable, because of the
      number of foreign technologies used (Java, ImageMagick,
      NetPBM, etc.) and different filesystems (Windows and Unix).
      Please mail them to the author or post a request on the
      Mambo-forum.
- maybe the implementation of the jHead EXIF-reader...it worked out fine
	for PHPGallery!
- adding bbCode support, and other graphical optionalities. However, I don't
	want to make zOOm into some kind of forum-software (The smilies code
	I have already derived from phpBB).
- eCards.
- if you know a nice feature you're missing, please mail me at: mailme@mikedeboer.nl

6. BUGFIXES
-----------
- colour problems with GD2 conversion library.
      I rewrote the GD-code and is currently tested by users.

--------
7. NOTES
--------
- This release took up a lot of time and effort, but I enjoyed it very much...I
	always tend to say programming is like making a somewhat complex puzzle.
	Well, before I offend people any further, I was to ask you all, users, this
	question: Do you have some server space available? It doesn't have to be
	much, just so that I can setup something like a support-system and base for
	future projects...HELP!
- If possible, with PHP & MySQL support...;-)
