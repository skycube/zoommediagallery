3. INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
----------------------------
1. COPY FILES
      Unzip all files into mambo root, leaving directory structure intact.
      CHMOD images/zoom to 777 (Unix)
      CHMOD components/com_zoom to 755 (Unix)
2. PUBLISH
      publish zOOm, by selecting Main Menu --> Install Custom.
      Then select zOOm Image Gallery. Publish zOOm 2.0 by
      selecting Main Menu --> Top Section --> Add
3. CONFIGURE zOOm
      Open your browser and load the Mambo front-end. Login
      as admin and select zOOm from your menu.
      Next, the installation screen appears: click YES and all
      the necessary tables and configuration are entered into
      the database. Change settings later in the Admin-system.

----------------------
4. UPDATE INSTRUCTIONS
----------------------
1. COPY NEWER FILES
	First, delete the old directory 'com_zoom' from the the 'components'
	directory. Then, unzip all newer files into the mambo-root, leaving
	directory structure intact.
2. UPDATE ZOOM TABLES
	Update your database by executing the file 'zoom20_UPDATEfrom1.0.sql'
	from phpMyAdmin or command line prompt.
3. FINISH THE JOB
	Create an empty file, called 'install.lock' in the directory 'components/
	com_zoom/', which will override the installation procedure.
	Then, login as Admin at the Mambo frontend and click the 'Admin-system'-
	link. Change your zOOm settings there.

-------------
5. USING ZOOM
-------------
- login on the frontpage, using your adminpassword
- Select zOOm and click on the Admin-system link; the adminoptions appear. You can
	* Create new galleries
	* Delete galleries
	* Edit gallerynames and descriptions
	* Upload files through the admin-menu
	* Change ALL of zOOm's variable settings AND
  you can also
	* Modify file-descriptions
	* Delete files
	* Add/ delete comments instantly through the frontpage!

6. TODO LIST
------------
- Not much, really. :-D BUT, bugs are inevitable, because of the
      number of foreign technologies used (Java, ImageMagick,
      NetPBM, etc.) and different filesystems (Windows and Unix).
      Please mail them to the author or post a request on the
      Mambo-forum.
- maybe the implementation of the jHead EXIF-reader...it worked out fine
	for PHPGallery!
- adding bbCode support, and other graphical optionalities. However, I don't
	want to make zOOm into some kind of forum-software (The smilies code
	I have already derived from phpBB).
- eCards.
- if you know a nice feature you're missing, please mail me at: mailme@mikedeboer.nl

-----------
7. BUGFIXES
-----------
- colour problems with GD2 conversion library.
      I rewrote the GD-code and is currently tested by users.

--------
8. NOTES
--------
- This release took up a lot of time and effort, but I enjoyed it very much...I
	always tend to say programming is like making a somewhat complex puzzle.
	Well, before I offend people any further, I was to ask you all, users, this
	question: Do you have some server space available? It doesn't have to be
	much, just so that I can setup something like a support-system and base for
	future projects...HELP!
- If possible, with PHP & MySQL support...;-)

	a good gallery component for Mambo as I :-P
